Code of CCOT-GW 
from the article "Co-clustering through Optimal Transport" - C. Laclau et al. , 2017


Files: 

- ccot_gw : contains the algorithms (built upon the implementation of the Gromov Wasserstein barycenters by Gabriel Peyre) 
- demo : run ccot_gw on synthetic data generated based on the Latent Block Models. One can easily change the number of simulations and the parameters of the simulated data. 

Folders:

- gromov-wasserstein : by Gabriel Peyre 
- misc : contains the files to simulate the data, convert the vectors into labels and evaluate the obtained partitions.
